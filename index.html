  <h1>Establishment</h1>
  <p class="text-justify text-oblique">Marc Randolph[25][26] and Reed Hastings founded Netflix on August 29, 1997 in Scotts Valley, California. Randolph worked as a marketing director for Hastings's company, Pure Atria.[27] Randolph had co-founded MicroWarehouse, a computer mail-order company; Borland International later employed him as vice president of marketing. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, sold Pure Atria to Rational Software Corporation in 1997 for $700 million in what was then the biggest acquisition in Silicon Valley history. The two came up with the idea for Netflix when commuting between their homes in Santa Cruz and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale while waiting for government regulators to approve the merger,[28] although Hastings has given several different explanations for how the idea came about.[29]

    Hastings invested $2.5 million in startup cash for Netflix.[30][13] Randolph admired the fledgling e-commerce company Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the Internet using a similar model. Hastings and Randolph considered and rejected VHS tapes as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship. When they heard about DVDs, first introduced in the United States on March 24, 1997,[31] they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings's house in Santa Cruz. When the disc arrived intact, they decided to take on the $16 billion home-video sales and rental industry.[28] Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for being late to return a copy of Apollo 13, but he and Randolph designed this apocryphal story to explain the company's business model and motivation.[28]
    
    Netflix launched as the world's first online DVD-rental store, with only 30 employees and 925 titles available—almost the entire catalogue of DVDs at the time[32]—using the pay-per-rent model, with rates and due dates similar to those of its brick-and-mortar competitor, Blockbuster.[33][28]</p>

  <h1>Headquarters and production hubs</h1>
  <p class="text-justify text-oblique">Netflix is headquartered in Silicon Valley, in the town of Los Gatos, California.[116][117] It also operates international offices in Asia, Europe and Latin America. In October 2018, Netflix acquired ABQ Studios, a film and TV production facility with eight sound stages in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The reported purchase price is under $30 million.[118] In July 2019, Netflix announced that it would be opening a hub at Shepperton Studios as part of a deal with Pinewood Group.[119] In April 2021, Netflix announced that it was opening its first Canadian headquarters in Toronto.[120] The company also announced that it would open an office in Sweden as well as Rome and Istanbul to increase its original content in those regions.[121] In June 2021, Netflix announced their first wholly-owned, full-service, post-production facility in Mumbai, India, the facility will be fully operational by June 2022 and have 40 offline editing suites.[122]

    The company has production hubs in Los Angeles,[123] Albuquerque[124] London[125] Madrid, Vancouver and Toronto.[126]</p>
